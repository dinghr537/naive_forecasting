## First about the environment

I'm using python 3.6 here for this homework (well python 3.6.13 exactly)

other packages can be installed by using pip $\rightarrow$ `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

if TA wants to train the model (not just using the existing model I've trained before, please follow the line 153 of the app.py)

## About data and the model
